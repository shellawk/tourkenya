                <h2>Hotels, lodges and tented camps.</h2>
                <p>At the mid-price level, some hotels are old settlers’ haunts that were once slightly grand and no longer quite fit in modern Kenya, while others are newer and cater for the Kenyan middle class. A few are fine – charmingly decrepit or fairly smart and semi-efficient – but a fair few are just boozy and uninteresting.</p>
                <p>As a rule, expect to pay anything from Ksh3000–10,000 for a decent double or twin room, with bathroom en suite, known in Kenya as “self-contained”. Breakfast is usually included, but if you want to have breakfast elsewhere, the price will be deducted. Features such as TV – often with DSTV (satellite) service – floor or ceiling fans and air conditioning will all put the price up, and are sometimes optional, allowing you to make significant savings at cheaper hotels.</p>
                <p>Older safari lodges may show their age with rather unimaginative design and boring little rooms (those that date back to the 1960s were built when just having a hotel in the bush was considered an achievement). Today, the best of the big lodges have public areas offering spectacular panoramas and game-viewing decks, while the rooms are often comfortable chalets or bandas. The most expensive, boutique lodges may have as few as just half a dozen rooms, constructed entirely of local materials, ingeniously open-fronted yet secure, with stunning views, and invigorating open-air showers.</p>

            <div class="accommodation">
                <h2>Boarding and lodgings.</h2>
                <p>In any town you’ll find basic guesthouses called boarding and lodgings. These can vary from a mud shack with water from the well to a multistorey building of en-suite rooms, complete with a bar and restaurant, and usually built around a lock-in courtyard/parking area. Most B&L bathrooms include rather alarmingly wired “instant showers”, giving a meagre spray of hot water 24 hours a day.</p>
                <p>While you can find a room for under Ksh1500 – and sometimes much less – in any town, prices are not a good indication of quality. If the bathrooms don’t have instant showers, then check the water supply and find out when the boiler will be on. The very cheapest places (as little as Ksh500 or less) will not usually have self-contained rooms, so you should check the state of the shared showers and toilets. You won’t cause offence by saying no thanks.</p>
                <p>The better B&Ls are clean and comfortable, but they tend to be airless and often double as informal brothels, especially if they have a bar. If the place seems noisy in the afternoon, it will become cacophonous during the night, so you may want to ask for a room away from the source of the din. Moreover, if it relies on its bar for income, security becomes an important deciding factor. Well-run B&Ls, even noisy, sleazy ones, always have uniformed security staff and gated access to the room floors. You can leave valuables with the manager in reception, though use your judgement.</p>

                <h2>Cottages and homestays.</h2>
                <p>Increasingly, it’s possible to book self-catering apartments, villas or cottages, especially on the coast. Try Langata Link Holiday Homes,Kenya Beach Rentals and Kenya Holiday House. Uniglobe Let’s Go Travel is a highly recommended agent for accommodation across the spectrum Also, try Airbnb, mostly for Nairobi and the coast.</p>

                <h2>Camping</h2>
                <p>If you’re on a budget and have a flexible itinerary, there are organized campsites (campgrounds) in Kenya, but bear in mind that, away from the parks and reserves, they are few and far between and almost non-existent on the coast. There are exceptions, however, such as around the lakes in the Rift Valley, and many hotels in the Central Highlands and Western Kenya allow campers to set up tents on their lawns and will provide bathroom facilities. If you do decide to carry a tent, bring the lightest one you can afford and remember its main purpose is to keep insects out, so one made largely of mosquito netting could be ideal.</p>
                <p>Kenya’s few privately owned campsites have toilets and showers with hot water and possibly a restaurant, bar and sometimes a swimming pool. Askaris are usually provided to guard tents and vehicles. Some also offer the option of renting a tent, and there may be other accommodation such as dorms and simple twin/double/triples, where bathroom facilities are usually shared with campers. These are often in basic bandas but they nearly always have adequate bedding and lighting.</p>
